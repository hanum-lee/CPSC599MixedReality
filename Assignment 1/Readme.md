# CPSC 599 Mixed Reality Assignment 1: Unity Chan
## How to use
My project used astronaut image target to find the anchor. Focusing on the image target will show the character.

## Bug
* The character starts moving when the application is launched, not when the target is found. It is highly recommanded to find the image target as soon as application starts.
* The animations are off.
